My Thought Process: I was pretty excited to know about my application progress and could'nt wait to check the contents of the Task provided.
As soon as i read "Next.js with Typescript and Tailwindcss" i knew this was not gonna be easy as ive never worked with the three and hadnt even installed or learnt them from any courses.
I watched a few introduction videos and understood that they were similar to the other frameworks i have used but i did not know it was gonna prove as a really challenging task.
Then i noticed the deadline, 24-36 hours would be the time taken for experienced devs, and me; a freshly graduated fresher whos done a handful of projects was definitely not gonna complete it within time.

Animation Libraries : I wasnt aware of the tailwindcss updates and lost 5 hours correcting and debugging and looking for solutions until i came across one, but it still didnt work on my machine.
I could not use TailwindCss which was pretty disappointing, as a frontend enthusiast all we would love to look as an end result is a visually attractive and pleasing website which i couldnt completely do,
which resulted in a plain and bland website which i would'nt think would be the outcome.
I managed to add a few of Framer Motion animations and overall i could say it was a great experience with Next.js as i was coding i could realise that it makes things easier than React js in many places.

Any known issues or improvements i would make with more time: My code logic consisted of redirecting from file to file which immediately came to my mind, but with the tight deadline i could'nt make it
more efficient, along with the loss of tailwindcss, i would solve the bug and implement beautiful animations with a different theme and effects which i had initially planned on like GreenSock which i came across
watching next.js tutorials.

Basically id take few mastercourses on Next.js and TailwindCss and build an equivalent or relatively competant website just like the one in the reference video.
